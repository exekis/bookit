# Bookit

This is **Bookit**, a little Firefox/Chrome extension I made for people (like me) who keep way too many tabs open (sometimes). You don’t want to close them because they might be important, maybe some research, an article, or just tabs you don’t want to lose. But now you can’t restart your browser or shut down your computer because you’re scared you’ll lose it all.

Here’s what Bookit does: you click the button, and it saves all your tabs into a folder called `Bookit` in your bookmarks. Inside that folder, it creates another one with today’s date. If you use it again on the same day, it’ll number the folder so that they don’t get messy.

That’s it. Now you can close/restart your browser. When you’re ready, just go to the folder, right-click, and reopen everything :)
